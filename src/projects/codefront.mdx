CodeFront, the hottest and coolest new weather application out there, provides simple forecasts for the current date and the following five days.
The user is instructed to search for forecasts via entering a city name, as this parameter will match city names within the data provided by the
OpenWeather API. A search history is generated once a forecast is displayed, and these buttons also allow users to view previously searched weather
data during their visit to the application.<br /><br />

With a clean and minimal user interface, CodeFront is able to display weather data easily and beautifully. Future updates will include new layouts
for smaller browser widths and screen sizes, along with fixes for various local storage issues.
